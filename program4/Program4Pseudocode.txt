create a new input file stream variable
create a new input file stream variable
create a new string stream variable

ask the user to input a text file name
ask the user to input a stop file name and save to new string variable

open the text file with the input file stream

if opening file is not successful
    display error message
    return 1

create a string variable storage // to store unique words
create a string variable temp1
create a string variable temp2
create a string variable temp3

extract one word from input file stream to temp1
append temp1 to storage
append ' ' to storage

while end of text file is not reached
    extract one word from input file stream to temp1
    
    open the storage string with the string stream
    
    while end of storage string is not reached
        extract one word from the string stream to temp2
        
        open the stop file with the file stream
        while end of stop file is not reached
            extract one word from the input fiel stream to temp3
            
                // to determine if a word is unique
                if temp1 is not equal to temp2 or temp3
                    append temp1 to storage
                    append ' ' to storage

// by now only unique words are stored into the storage string

create a new int variable numUniqueWords

for int x = 0; x < length of storage string; x++
    if storage string.at(x) is equal to ' '
        increment numUniqueWords

create an int array counter with size of numUniqueWords

creare a string array words with size of numUnique words

for int x = 0; x < numUniqueWords; x++
    open the storage string with the string stream
    
    extract a word from the string stream and save it to words[x]


for int x = 0; x < length of numUniqueWords; x++
    go to the start of the text file with the first (outer) input file stream
    
    while end of text file is not reached
        if words[x] is equal to the extractred word from the input file stream
        increment counter[x]

for int x = 0; x < numUniqueWords x++
    print words[x] ": " counter[x]
